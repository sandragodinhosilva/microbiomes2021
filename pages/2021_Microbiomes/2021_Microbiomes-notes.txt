A BGC can be defined as a physically clustered group of two or more genes in a particular genome that together encode a biosynthetic pathway for the production of a specialized metabolite (including its chemical variants) bacterial natural products are generally clustered into contiguous stretches of DNA  PKS biosynthetic enzymes  resistance enzymes specific to the produced metabolite  enzymes required to produce unusual building blocks regulatory machinery to control transcription in the native host.

These compounds improve bacterial fitness through selective and specific interactions with biological targets Polyketides are synthesized in bacteria, fungi, plants, and certain marine animals by the stepwise condensation of acetyl-CoA or propionyl-CoA with malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl -CoA extender units. Each condensation reaction is driven by the decarboxylation of the extender unit and yields a beta-keto functional group (e.g., an acetoacetyl group; this is why the ultimate product is called a polyketide).


---#9
These compounds improve bacterial fitness through selective and specific interactions with biological targets Polyketide antibiotics include many of the most commonly used antibiotics in medicine today such as erythromycin, rapamycin and avermectin .

AT – selects the new unit of the polyketone chain activated by coenzyme A and transfers to ACP KS – forms the C-C bond between the new unit and the growing chain (decarboxylative condensation) ACP – transfers the new unit from AT to KS domain and the growing chain from KS to the optional keto-processing domains and the ks of the next module Further processing domains (ketoreductase (KR), dehydratase (DH), and enoylreductase (ER)) are used to catalyze the step-wise reduction of the b-keto group. The remarkable structural diversity observed among type I PKS-derived polyketides arises largely from the combinatorial use of these modules, the variable use of three reductive domains, and a few simple building blocks such as acetate

from Saccharopolyspora  erythraea - 6-deoxyerythronolide B (6-dEB) synthase three megasynthases encoded by three ORFs, DEBS1–3 All the modules encoded within DEBS1–3 are required for successful synthesis of 6-dEB and act in succession, like a giant molecular assembly line. the product of one module in a polyketide synthesis pathway is passed on to the correct, subsequent module in the pathwa How is it that reactive intermediates are directed vectorially along the assembly line? vectorial specificity is due to the protein-protein interactions of the faces of the different protein modules in the pathways. Polyketides are synthesized by multienzyme polypeptides that resemble eukaryotic fatty acid synthase but are often much larger.


---#12
In addition to the clinical relevance and abundance of polyketides, there is one other reason behind the particular interest in polyketides as promising targets for synthetic biology: the highly modular architecture of both the BGCs and the constituent polyketide synthases (PKS) presents an ideal starting point from which to engineer chemical novelty in polyketides.

S.parvulus: actinorhodin - antibiotic activity The selection of a heterologous host is contingent upon its ability to efficiently transcribe non-native pathways, translate the often GC rich transcripts, and possess all the starter and extender units necessary for polyketide production E. coli seems to be well suited for expression of pathways originating from Cyanobacteria that are challenging to modify genetically. The titres of SMs produced in E. coli have been generally low. Furthermore, synthetic biology allows the redesign of BGCs for effective heterologous expression in pre-engineered hosts, which will ultimately empower the construction of standardized high-throughput platforms for natural product discovery


---#16
Since E. coli and S. cerevisiae are not naturally equipped for production of complex chemicals , issues with metabolic flux, codon usage, self-resistance and activation of biosynthetic acyl/peptidyl carrier proteins need to be resolved To guarantee successful translation: Directed promoter replacement Use a host that is closely related to the native strain and rely on the native promoters from the gene cluster to be functional

We were specially intrigued by a particular genus, the Aquimarina genus Polyketides: structurally complex & diverse secondary metabolites (examples: Erythromycin, Tetracyclines, Avermectin )

After the results from the genomic inspection of the genus Aquimarina, coupled with the interesting results in the screening for drug-like activities, we ended in an urgent question: Is Aquimarina an isolated case among the Flavobacteriacae family and the Phylum bacteroidetes. These are well know for its degrading capabilities, not for the biosynthetic potential. The plan that we came up to answer this question is based on the exploitation of metagenomics.

antiSMASH can work with different formats of data. Data can be uploaded in Genbank (recommended), EMBL, or plain FASTA format. The quality of the prediction by antiSMASH is highly dependent on the quality of the input data. If you analyze poor quality draft genomes with many (thousands)  of small contigs and low N 50 , antiSMASH may not be able to detect gene clusters if they are scattered over multiple contigs. Please be also aware, that many of the specificity determination algorithms in antiSMASH depend on the presence/absence of conserved amino acids at specific positions in the enzyme sequence. If the sequence quality is low and thus also the amino acid of the translated proteins cannot be fully trusted all predictions have to be taken with precautions.
